## **Bernard Boys Mafia™ Presents**: _La Carta di Sangue_
> The official “**Blood Paper**” for Bernard Wars.

[**Bernard Boys Mafia**™](https://bernardboys.io/) is an NFT Project — founded by four individuals, who shared a common interest in Cardano, the future of blockchain technology, and the many use-cases for non-fungible tokens. The artwork was inspired by our Founder’s late St. Bernard and is honored throughout several of our policy IDs. Coincidentally, this inspiration also served as a basis behind the Bernard Wars lore.

### NFT based idle-RPG game on Cardano
> Bernard Wars.
> 
> It’s the ultimate battle for supremacy, where a fight for control to reap the greatest benefits in the _Bernard Universe_ takes place. Built on Cardano; you can expect the latest in UI/UX game designs and dedicated data storage hosting technologies to ensure speed, responsiveness and safety.
> 

### Recognized Landmarks and Goals
> North Star.
> 
> Ultimately, we want to work towards a goal that allows our entire gaming ecosystem the maximum degree of interoperability; in which all assets such as NFTs, tokens or currencies can be traded on-chain. 
> 
> We will be white labeling our products and services out to other NFT Projects; which can be exchanged for rewards, earned through **Staking Missions** and **Raiding**. Additionally, other NFT Projects will have an option to sign-up and apply to have their own NFTs staked within our ecosystem. In doing this, they may also offer their own coin (_cryptocurrency_) to their community as a reward for holding their NFTs.
> 
> We have lofty goals and will not be achieved overnight. But with a sound strategy in place, we can accomplish these goals.
> 
> This includes:
> * Creating unparalleled **NFT art**. So much so, that it _begs_ to be in every person’s wallet and proudly shown off.
> * Attracting capable, community-rich Moderators that are passionate about engaging with others.
> * Retaining intelligent, “alpha-NFT Players” whose standards and principles match our own.
> * Launching our gamified NFT staking ecosystem, Bernard Wars, an idle-RPG game on Cardano.
> * Utilizing in-game profit to further reward our stakeholders holding any asset from our [**NFT collection**](https://reginaldcg.github.io/carta-sanguigna/another-page.html).

### Gamification in CNFT
> Game Components.
> 
> To understand the game mechanics, we first need to explore the various elements that make up our ecosystem and their suggested purposes. Secondly, we’ll delve into **Tokenomics**. Finally, we will outline the framework in-depth. This is an iterative development process; which means, that these plans are subject to change as the system evolves over time. This, [whitepaper](https://medium.com/@bernardboysnft), will serve as our direction; in which new roadmaps and whitepapers will be derived from.

>
> - **Dispensary**  
>     - The Dispensary will be where you can get WL spots for Projects partnering with Bernard Boys Mafia™.

Notably, the claiming process will be hands off and fully autonomous.

>
> - **Garage**

The project will foster liquidity and real-world use for one token within the gaming ecosystem: $NARD. However, the staking missions, missions, gameplay and unforeseen on-chain uses (tip bots for example) will have a wide array of tokens with various in-game utility.

Any token and policy not listed here will not have a specific supply or distribution as it’s intent is in-game only rewards, but we want to make all in-game assets tradable when possible, so, there will be a wide array of policy id’s associated with the game and will be able to be inspected.

*   **Token: $NARD / Supply: 5,000,000,000  
    **_Purpose:_ ¹Used to unlock project level rewards for other NFT non-Partner Projects. ²Able to be used instead of speed ups, materials or other tokens or buffs in the game. ³Used to get powerful items from The Pawn Shop. ⁴Able to be used to mint collections.
*   **Token: $SHINE / Supply: 500,000,000,000  
    **_Purpose:_ ¹Used primarily to build items or upgrade items in game. ²Needed in game to build items for your Mansion. ³Earned through Staking Missions, Missions and in game challenges and quests. ⁴Not a protected resource and can be raided by other players.
*   **Token: $OSSA / Supply: 500,000,000,000,000  
    **_Purpose:_ ¹Easy to earn coin but is needed to start playing the game. ²Needed to do things in the game, like gas or energy. ³Able to be won or lost in raids. ⁴Be made available and registered in tip bots.

Spend of tokens in game returns the tokens to the project wallet for redistribution as rewards to keep the ecosystem self sustaining. A large portion of the bank for $SHINE and $OSSA will be utilized for game rewards to ensure adequate rewards can be allocated.

Distribution of the tokens will be as follows: Team will be distributed their share of $NARD over time, as to reduce the risk of price volatility and ensure long term success. It’s estimated that it will take five years to fully distribute.

Air drops won’t be completed at once. Game items include the ability to purchase packs and chests with $NARD and other items and all other aspects except Staking Missions.

Mobile-friendly comes to mind. The game, staking components and other game elements will be oriented for mobile usage. Meaning, there’s an emphasis on being able to capture a wider audience; before any other forms adaptation takes place, such as desktop use.

Again, this document is a forward look into the vision for the product. Development resources are limited, at the time of writing, and it will take time to realize this vision. However, iterative development allows us to consistently prioritize and deliver the most valuable items as set by the community while remaining true to our vision and north star.

Staking Missions will be our priority and will be our sole focus. Once this has been released, we will focus on a few Flex Studio items while we polish the UI and fix issues with the Staking Missions. In the background, a new release plan will be developed to deliver a new feature to the ecosystem. Then, the same process will repeat until the game is complete.

This timeline is long and depends on many external factors, and, as such, has a high amount of risk associated with all new endeavors. This paper is not a promise to deliver functionality. Please check our Discord or web site for the current delivery plans and set expectations accordingly.

Our mission is to promote $ADA and Cardano NFTs through art and development of a NFT based game ecosystem which is fun and safe. We believe art and gaming are perfect fits for the modern world of digital ownership and work to promote this fact and empower game players to take control of their assets. We contribute to the development and thought leadership in the space with open-source tools and architectures for developers and non-Partner Projects. We enable other non-Partner Projects to make use of our tools for their users so they may have more enjoyment out of their collections.

Make no mistake, Bernard Boys Mafia™ is an art project first. We provide the best-in-class entertainment and gaming for our holders of today, but we also believe the long-term resale (hundreds of years) and utility is stored in the art. As such, we make NFTs which can be proudly displayed, shared and admired by diverse groups across the globe within the Mafia Universe. Best-in-class profile NFTs will always be our bread-and-butter.

Our doors are open and are seeking to provide more opportunities for others. If you are a skilled Technologist, are proficient in business, or a result-driven Marketer, reach out to us directly on [**Discord**](https://t.co/Tgl0RM9lO5) or [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/BernardBoysNFT).
